--- DONE ---
1. add probability distributions for champ rolling
1.5. add a way to pre-process this info and store it in a file every time refresh is called, so it doesn't have to be calculated every time someone rolls
2. add place to store who has what splash pieces 
7. DEBUGGING: add a way to force a specific champ roll 
9. update people's progress on their collection
3. add special message for when someone completes a splash 
12. "divorce" option
2.7. limit rolls per hour
13. info command (shows full champion)
1. show other people's harems with ($harem <@otherperson>)
6. store dupes of same piece (if someone has one and rolls another, they'll have two - alter data structure for this)
3. allow search by id for skin info also
4. trading? (IN TESTING PHASE RIGHT NOW)
5. use reactable embed for champ splash list instead of text
BUG: `$harem @tag` was showing message sender's name as title instead
2. add sorting by rarity/name on the harem list
    2.5. add rarity icons to harem list
    2.7 UPON NEXT BOT RESTART, ADD RARITY TO EVERYONE'S HAREMS
--- END DONE ----
3. add 10 year anniversary splashes to list 
4. use an embed for trading
9. stretch goal: do animation for progress pic a la roll color
7. add guild key to roll-timer, so roll timer isn't user-dependent but rather server-dependent
   but also we're mainly using this just on Lounge anyways
2.5. store completed splashes also
5. trading up system 
8. stretch goal: add some sort of 'quality' for each roll
6. split bios into 4 pieces as well
???. change harem.json architecture to {user_id:champ_id:{A?,B?,C?,D?}} where A-D are counts?

11???. make everything non-dupe 
    - (note: should forced rolls be allowed to create dupes?)
    - no longer store multiple copies of a skin in harems.json
    - add a 'rolled' set so even through refreshes, we know what's already taken
    - implementation: 
        1. we remove it from pool: note: upon refreshes, immediately update the pool to reflect rolled set
        2. add to rolled set and if someone rolls something in rolled set, we simply keep rolling until they get unclaimed one
